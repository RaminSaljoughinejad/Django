    "You may ask, what if I want to show it as an editable field, but populated automatically with a proper slug?<br>\n",
    "For that you, you can costumize the administrative area. This type of costumization is known as advanced configurations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure how the fields are shown and/or how they should behave you should go to your admin.py and create a new class.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Navigate to your admin.py page and create a class (if you want to follow the best practices you should call the class exactly like your model+Admin)<br>\n",

    "3- Make sure that you pass this class to admin.site.register as a second argument<br>\n",
