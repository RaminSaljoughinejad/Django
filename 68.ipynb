    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a helper function inside your views.py (not in the IndexView class!) and call it store_file.\n",
    "2. This function should have an input argument called file.\n",
    "3. Inside this function use python to write the file in a directory called 'temp/' and add a name for the name you want for the file.\n",
    "    - Please undertand that for now you need to choose the extension of you file exactly alike your file which you are going to upload. Later I will tell you how to do it automatically.\n",
    "4. Set the mode to 'wb+'\n",
    "5. As you know from our python course, you can now just call the write command for saving the file, but it is not a good approach, let me explain why:\n",
    "    - When you write the whole data in a file, the system will read it entirely and move it to the ram! What if you dont have anough space in your ram? or what if a great number of users decide to upload a file at the same time to your server? You see where I am going?\n",
    "    - so instead of writing the whole file as once we cut it into chunks and then write it chunk by chunk untill it is finished.\n",
    "    - to do so, write a for loop that runs for every chunk in file.chunks(), and inside the for loop we write it to the file.\n",
    "6. Now, instead of printing the file, call the store_file function and pass it the file.\n",
    "7. Don't forget to add the 'temp' folder inside your project directory otherwise you will get a 'FileNotFoundError'.\n",
    "    - Please understand that the the python code we wrote in the store_file function will assume the root of your project as the root place for loking for the 'temp' dicrectory and not the app directory.\n",
    "    - To make sure that you won't make a mistake: add the temp folder next to your manage.py file.\n",
