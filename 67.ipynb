    "### Handling File Uploads:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that we need to do is to handle form submition:<br>\n",
    "1. In your index.html template, find the form tag and add an action attribute and point at '/profiles/'\n",
    "    - Since in the root projects url file we defined our path as 'profiles/' you need to add the '/' at the end of your address for the action attribute.\n",
    "2. Also, set the method for this form to POST\n",
    "3. Now, since you have a form with a file input, you need to add a third attribute called enctype.\n",
    "    - The enctype attribute value needs to be set to 'multipart/form-data'\n",
    "    - specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitting it to the server. The enctype='multipart/form-data' value is used when you need to upload files along with other form data.\n",
    "    - When you set enctype='multipart/form-data', the browser breaks the form data into different parts. Each part has its own content type and content disposition headers, making it possible to handle different types of data appropriately.\n",
    "4. Now, you need to give the file input a name so that you can later target it ['image'].\n",
    "5. Navigate to views.py and lets provide the post method with some code.\n",
    "    - You can now access the file using request.FILES['image']\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment just print the request.FILES['image'] and then just redirect to the same url.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your view.py file should look like the following block:"
