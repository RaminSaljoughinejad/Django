    "AbstractUser\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - AbstractUser is a more complete and feature-rich base class for creating custom user models.\n",
    "    - It provides all the fields and methods commonly needed for a user model out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Includes common fields such as username, first_name, last_name, email, password, groups, user_permissions, is_staff, is_active, is_superuser, last_login, and date_joined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use AbstractUser if you need to extend the default Django user model with additional fields or methods, but want to retain all the built-in functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AbstractBaseUser\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - AbstractBaseUser provides the bare minimum for a custom user model, offering a lot more flexibility for defining a completely custom user model.\n",
    "    - It includes only the core authentication functionality, without any of the fields or methods provided by AbstractUser.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Includes only the password, last_login, and is_active fields.\n",
    "    - Requires you to define additional fields such as username or email, and manage user authentication and permissions more manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use AbstractBaseUser if you need to build a custom user model from scratch, with completely different fields and authentication logic than what is provided by Django’s default user model."
