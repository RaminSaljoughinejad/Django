    "1. The first thing that you want to do when you are using sessions is to go the settings.py file and make sure that 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware' is inside the MIDDLEWARE list.<br>\n",
    "    - It should be there by defualt, but if it isn't, you should add it.<br>\n",
    "2. You also want to make sure that 'django.contrib.session' is inside the INSTALLED_APPS list, and again if it is not, add it.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, we are going to tell django, that how long should a session live.<br>\n",
    "    - To do that, create a variable called SESSION_COOKIE_AGE at the bottom of the sessions.pt file and pass the time in seconds (If you dont set this it would be set to 2weeks by default).\n",
    "    - I am not going to set it! and leave it to be as the defualt.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Navigate to the template you added the button.\n",
    "    - What we want to do here is to send a request to server when the buttton is clicked, then run some logic which is going to allow us do what we wanted.\n",
    "    - Wrap the button in a form so that you can send a request to server when it is pressed.\n",
    "        - The form method should be POST and the action is going to be a new address (I choose '/reviews/favorite')\n",
    "5. Now we need to send some data with the form to the server so that the serve know which review is going to be the favorite.\n",
    "        - add an input with type='hidden', name='review_id', and value = {{ review.id }}\n",
