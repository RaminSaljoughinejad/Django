    "### Relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django, relationships between models play a crucial role in structuring and organizing data. These relationships define how different entities are connected to each other in a database, enabling powerful data querying and manipulation capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of relationships supported by Django, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    One-to-Many (ForeignKey): In this type of relationship, each record in one model can be associated with multiple records in another model. This is achieved by using a ForeignKey field in the model that \"owns\" the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many-to-One (Reverse ForeignKey): This is the reverse of a ForeignKey relationship. Each record in one model can be associated with only one record in another model, but the second model can have multiple records related to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many-to-Many (ManyToManyField): This type of relationship allows each record in one model to be associated with multiple records in another model, and vice versa. This is useful for representing complex relationships where multiple entities can be connected to each other in various combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and effectively utilizing these relationships is essential for designing robust database schemas and building efficient Django applications. By defining and managing relationships between models, you can create sophisticated data structures that accurately represent real-world scenarios and support complex data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain each of these relationship types with examples:\n",
    "One-to-Many (ForeignKey):\n",
    "\n",
    "In a One-to-Many relationship, also known as a ForeignKey relationship, each record in one model can be associated with multiple records in another model. However, each record in the second model is associated with only one record in the first model. This relationship is established by using a ForeignKey field in the model that \"owns\" the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a scenario where we have two models: Author and Book. Each author can write multiple books, but each book is written by only one author. \n",
    "In this example, the Book model has a ForeignKey field author that references the Author model. This establishes a One-to-Many relationship, where each book is associated with one author, but each author can have multiple books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-One (Reverse ForeignKey):\n",
    "\n",
    "A Many-to-One relationship is the reverse of a ForeignKey relationship. In this type of relationship, each record in one model can be associated with only one record in another model, but the second model can have multiple records related to it. This is achieved by using a ForeignKey field in the second model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Building upon the previous example, let's consider the Many-to-One relationship from the perspective of the Author model. Each author can have multiple books, but each book is authored by only one author. \n",
    "In this example, the Book model includes a ForeignKey field author that references the Author model. Each book is associated with one author, creating a Many-to-One relationship between books and authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-Many (ManyToManyField):\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Many-to-Many relationship, each record in one model can be associated with multiple records in another model, and vice versa. This type of relationship is useful for representing complex relationships where multiple entities can be connected to each other in various combinations. This is achieved by using a ManyToManyField in both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a scenario where we have two models: Student and Course. Each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students enrolled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both the Student and Course models include a ManyToManyField. This establishes a Many-to-Many relationship, where each student can be associated with multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students enrolled."

    "Lets add a new data model to our models.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This models is supposed to hold data regarding actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Navigate to your app's models.py file\n",
    "2- Create a new class called Actor\n",
    "3- This class have 2 attributes: first_name, and last_name. \n",
    "4- The first_name and last_name attribute are Charfields that can not be left null, and have the max length of 100 characters (you may want to label them as an db_index so you perform faster searching on it in the future)<br>\n",
    "5- Now, you can change the field type of the main_act attribute in the Movie class. Change it to model.ForeignKey.\n",
    "6- The ForeignKey field type requires two arguments. \n",
    "- The first one is the name of the class that you want to link to this field (Movie).\n",
    "- And the second one is the on_delete argument. You may ask why?... well the first thing that comes to mind is that what if an actors data get deleted from the first class! what should happen to the row that was connected to this actor? and you have various options here:\n",
    "    - You can tell Django that if an actor data is deleted, the row associated to that actor should also get deleted. This is called 'CASCADE' and if you want it, you should pass models.CASCADE as the second argument to the ForeignKey field.\n",
    "    - You can also tell Django that if an actor data is being used in here, then is should not be possible to delete that actor from the table. This is called 'PROTECT' and if you want it you should pass models.PROTECT as the second argument to the ForeignKey field.\n",
    "    - Another option that you have here is 'SET_NULL' which basically tells django to set this field to null if the associated actor gets deleted from the first table (models.SET_NULL).\n",
    "    - There are other options too that you can check in Django Documentation.\n",
    "7- Set the ForeignKey's second argument to CASCADE\n",

    "Your models.py file should look like the following:"
