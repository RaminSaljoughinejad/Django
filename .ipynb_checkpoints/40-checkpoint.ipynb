    "### Aggregation Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to display the total number of movies in your database along with the average rating. How do you go about achieving this? The answer lies in aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation methods are built-in functionalities provided by Django. These methods empower us to access and compute various summary statistics or calculations over sets of data. Whether it's counting the number of records, calculating averages, or even performing more complex operations, aggregation is the tool we turn to for such tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use aggregation to determine the total count of movies and compute the average rating across all movies. This allows us to distill meaningful insights from our data and present them in a concise and informative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django, aggregation methods enable us to perform these calculations efficiently, providing us with the aggregated results we need to make informed decisions and gain deeper insights into our dataset. Whether you're building a data analysis tool, crafting reports, or simply exploring your data, aggregation is a powerful technique that you'll frequently leverage in your Django projects."

    "At first glance, you might wonder why we're seeing {'rating__avg': 7.3} instead of just 7.3 for the average rating. Well, this format is a result of how Django's aggregation functions return their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the aggregate() method to compute the average rating, Django returns a dictionary-like object containing the aggregated results. In this case, the key rating__avg corresponds to the average rating value. The rating__avg syntax is Django's way of indicating that the average value is calculated for the rating field.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to extract the actual average rating value from the dictionary, you would access it using the key rating__avg. This format is designed to provide flexibility and accommodate scenarios where multiple aggregations are performed simultaneously or when aliases are used in aggregation queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to display the average rating value without the dictionary-like formatting, you can access it directly using rating__avg key in your template or manipulate the result in your view to extract the value as needed. This ensures that the aggregated data is presented in a clear and understandable format to your users.\n",
