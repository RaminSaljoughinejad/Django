    "Function overloading allows multiple functions within the same scope to have the same name but different parameter lists. The appropriate function is called based on the type of parameters provided when the function is invoked. In our case, one function would be called when a string is passed as an argument, and another function would be called when an integer is passed. <span style='color:red;'>THIS IS NOT ACHIEVEABLE IN PYTHON</span>.\n",

THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT EVERY DATA TYPE IN PYTHON COULD BE CONVERTED TO STRING, SO, WHEN YOU CALL THE PATH WITH THE STRING CASTING FIRST, YOU ARE STOPING THE DJANGO SERVER FROM CHECKING WHETHER THE VALUE IS CASTABLE TO OTHER TYPES OR NOT.\n",
