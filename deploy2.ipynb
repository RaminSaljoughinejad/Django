    "                    - Technically you could, but doing it will cause security problems. Let me explain why: Your static files could contain javascript fiels for example, as long as they are your code as the developer there is no problem, hoever if a user fins a way of uploading their own javascript code with some cruppted code, they your website will start sending them to all the users and thats a bad thing!!!! <br>\n",
